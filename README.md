The famous `donut.c` program, but better!

# So whats the difference?

Now, you can choose the colour that you want your donut to be, simply by running an argument with the hexcode of whatever colour you want!

# Installation

## Homebrew

`brew tap aa830/donut.c`
`brew install donut`


# Usage
For example, if I wanted to run donut.c (compiled) with a shade of red:

`donut --FF0000`

Just be sure to add "--" as the argument before your hexcode.

You now also have the `--rainbow` argument! Just run and see what it looks like!

More updates to come!
